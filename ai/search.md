# Uninformed Search

- no additional information about states beyond problem defination
- generate successors and determine if a state is goal state or not

## Breadth First Search

- root node is expanded
- then its successors
- then their successors
- **Performance Measure**
  - Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b^d)$
  - Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b^d)$
