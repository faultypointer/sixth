# History of AI

## 1943: Artificial Neurons

- first work on AI; by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts
- proposed a model of artificial neurons where each neuron is either `on` or `off`
  - a switch to `on` occurs when it gets sufficient stimulation from neighboring neurons
- they showed any computable function could be computed by some network of connected neurons
- all logical connectives (`and`, `or`, `not`) could be implemented by simple net structures
- also suggested that sutably defined networks could learn

### 1949: Hebbian learning

- Donald Hebb demonstrated simple updating rule to modify the strength between neurons

## 1950: First Neural Network

- Marvin Minskey and Dean Edmonds build the first neural network, SNARC, at Harvard

## 1950: Alan Turing

- published "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"
- where he introduced Turing Test, machine learning, genetic algoritms, and reinforcement learning
